->To call functions in other c files, the following syntax may be used:
    ` #include "filepath" `
And, then note that compiling and running main.c would be sufficient.


->Remember to pass positional argument for fwrite() in updative functions.

->The following are the structs used: (change size as needed)
1. books:
`
    typedef struct book{
        char author[30];
        char title[100];
        char publisher[100];
        char available_UID[100][10];
        char issued_UID[100][10];
        int available_copies;
        int issued_copies;
    }BOOK;
`
2. Issue by SID:
` 
    typdef struct SID{
        char sid[50];
        char issued_uid_sid[10][10];
        char title_sid[10][100];
        (?) date; //array of dates
    }SID_ISSUE;
`
The date datatype is TBD, refer time.h

3. Log format:
`
    typedef struct entry{
        (?) date;
        char action[4][10]; //add,remove,issue,submit
        BOOK2 book; //define a new struct BOOK2, a subset struct of BOOK
        char id[10]; //SID,admin id(AID);
        char UID[10]; //can be included in BOOK2
    }
